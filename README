The shell script "filter" translates location information inside a json file into formatted csv results. The formatted results are inside "formatted_location.csv".

If you delete "location", "location.csv", "twitter_id", "twitter_id.csv", and "formatted_location.csv", by running

chmod u+x filter
./filter

on any linux server that contains a python3 implementation, you should be able to reproduce the same results in "formatted_location.csv".
